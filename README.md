# Starbucks-offers-prediction
This is a capstone project finished for Udacity Machine Learning Engineering Course.

## Project Background
Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.

A data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app including transaction, demographic and offer is given to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.

Some basic data analysis are done on simulated data including which offer are most popular and who are mostly likely to complete an offer. A model is built to predict whether or note someone will respond to an offer to help better customer targeting in the future.

## Installations
